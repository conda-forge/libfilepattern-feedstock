  summary: C++ library to store and filter files with systematic naming conventions using simplified regular expression-like patterns
  description: |
    The filepattern utility is used to store files that follow a pattern, where the pattern is analogous 
    to a simplified regular expression. The need for filepattern arises in situations where large amounts 
    of data with a systematic naming convention needs to be filtered by patterns in the naming. 
    For example, one may have a directory containing segmented images where the name contains information 
    such as the channel, the column value, and the row value. filepattern provides the ability to extract 
    all images containing such a naming pattern, filter by the row or column value, or group files by one
    or more of the aforementioned variables.
